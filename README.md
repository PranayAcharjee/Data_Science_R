## Caesarian Delivery Prediction Dataset - Data Preprocessing
This repository contains the code and dataset for the Caesarian Delivery Prediction project. The goal of this project was to predict whether a pregnant woman is likely to have a caesarian delivery based on various attributes.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of information on 80 pregnant women. It includes the following attributes:

Id: A unique identifier for each woman.
Age: The age of the pregnant woman.
Weight: The weight of the pregnant woman.
Delivery Number: The number of previous deliveries the woman has had.
Delivery Time: The time it took for delivery.
Blood Pressure: The blood pressure levels of the woman.
Heart Problem: Indicates whether or not the woman has a heart problem.
Caesarian: The target variable indicating whether the woman had a caesarian delivery (1) or not (0).

#### Project Overview

In this project, we focused on data preprocessing to ensure the dataset is clean and suitable for analysis. The following steps were performed:

* Importing the Dataset: The dataset was imported into the project environment for further analysis and preprocessing.

* Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset were identified and appropriate techniques were used to handle them. This ensured that the dataset was complete and no valuable information was lost.

Dealing with Data Types and Conversion: The data types of the attributes were examined, and conversions were performed as necessary. This step included transforming categorical variables into numerical representations, ensuring consistency in data types, and facilitating subsequent analysis.

Dealing with Outliers: Outliers, if present, were identified and treated appropriately. Outliers can significantly impact the analysis and modeling process, so it was important to handle them to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

Univariate Exploration: Univariate exploration was conducted on each individual variable in the dataset. This involved analyzing the distributions, ranges, and characteristics of the variables separately, providing valuable insights into their behavior.

Usage
To use the code and replicate the data preprocessing steps, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies and libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

Run the code file data_preprocessing.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook or any other suitable environment.

Follow the instructions within the code to load and preprocess the dataset.

After preprocessing, the cleaned dataset can be used for further analysis, predictive modeling, or classification tasks.

Conclusion
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data analysis, and this project focused on preparing the Caesarian Delivery Prediction dataset for further analysis. By handling missing values, dealing with data types and conversion, and addressing outliers, we ensured that the dataset was clean and ready for analysis. Univariate exploration provided insights into the individual variables, aiding in the understanding of their distributions and characteristics. The preprocessed dataset can now be used for various predictive modeling or classification tasks related to caesarian delivery prediction.
